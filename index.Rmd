## Welcome to My Data Visualization Journey

As a student in MATH 230: Data Visualization & Computing, I've explored the art and science of transforming data into meaningful visual stories. This portfolio showcases my growth and accomplishments throughout the semester.

## About Me

I'm Aiden Kim, a student at Bucknell University with a passion for data analysis and visualization. Through this course, I've developed skills in:

- Statistical visualization techniques
- Interactive dashboard creation
- R programming and RMarkdown
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Principles of effective visual communication

## Featured Project: NBA Elite Player Analysis

My final project explores NBA player performance through the lens of advanced analytics. Using interactive visualizations, I examine questions like:

- How do offensive and defensive metrics correlate across different positions?
- What is the relationship between usage rate and efficiency?
- Which players provide the most value relative to their minutes played?

The dashboard allows users to filter by position, minutes played, and other criteria to perform customized analysis of NBA's elite players.

## My Visualization Philosophy

Effective data visualization combines aesthetic appeal with analytical clarity. I strive to create visualizations that:

1. Present information accurately and transparently
2. Utilize appropriate visual encodings for different data types
3. Guide the viewer's attention to key insights
4. Maintain accessibility through thoughtful color choices and clear labeling
5. Tell a cohesive story about the underlying data
